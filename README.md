In this project, I (@Usool-Data-Science) and my partner (@etchiemcdonald) create a printf clone. The project is broken down into various parts including the following sections:

Section 0: (A function that produces output according to a format)
==================================================================
Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ... );
Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
write output to stdout, the standard output stream
format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
- C
You don't have to handle the flag characters
You don't have to handle field width
You don't have to handle precision
You don't have to handle the Length modifiers
Add other advance tasks Like handling flags, field width, precision and Length modifiers.

Section 1: (Let the function handle the following identifies)
=============================================================
- d
- i
You don’t have to handle the flag characters
You don’t have to handle field width
You don’t have to handle precision
You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

Add other advance tasks like handling flags, field width, precision and length modifiers.
